This course is intended as a second course in information assurance for undergraduate students as well as other qualified students.  It is also intended as a foundation course for graduate digital forensics studies. (Cross-listed with CYBR 4380, CYBR 8386).",
      "Digital forensics involves the preservation, identification, extraction, analysis and documentation of digital evidence stored on a variety of electronic devices. The aim of this course is to introduce students to acceptable approaches for collecting, analyzing and reporting data from a forensics investigation. Topics include: an introduction to digital forensics, data acquisition, first response, memory forensics, operating system forensics, and network forensics. Students will be required to perform several forensics analyses in a controlled lab environment, including acquiring forensically sound hard drive images, memory images and analyzing these using industry standard tools, such as Forensic Toolkit (FTK).  The Digital Forensics class is designed for Cybersecurity, Computer Science and other qualified students to learn what actions are both appropriate and required for preserving, collecting and analyzing digital evidence in cases of intrusion, data theft or other cybercrimes. (Cross-listed with CYBR 4380).",

It will introduce methods that are commonly used to trade-off the various architectural choices to design systems with the desired cost-performance requirements. The course will provide a systems level perspective to design. The emphasis will be on the cache, memory and I/O subsystems, system interconnects leading to distributed shared-memory multiprocessor systems. Multiprocessor clusters based on message passing and high-performance processor architecture will be covered. The course will also provide a brief overview of emerging system architectures including quantum computing and those used to facilitate machine learning applications.",
