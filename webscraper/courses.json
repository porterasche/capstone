It sought to investigate the subject matter of history, that is, the historical process itself. Consequently, philosophers of history aimed at comprehensive views of this process. During the twentieth century, however, philosophy of history became \"analytical or critical.\" The aim of this approach is to question and criticize the ways that historians work, so issues of knowledge and explanation have become very important for the present-day philosopher of history.
